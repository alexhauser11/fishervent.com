                    <h2>From Tennis and Dentistry, to Ventriloquism!</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've been a dentist my entire adult life but I needed and wanted more.
                        Looking for a new passion I stumbled upon ventriloquism!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even before dentistry I've always believed in pursueing ones passions
                        and gifts. So, I was a Tennis Professional and a Teacher sometime ago,
                        before helping people in Dentistry Field
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today I enjoy bringing laughter and joy to children, families and those
                        in need of a friend!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I even teach ventiloquism courses at SouthEast Community College.

                    <p>
                        My last life began when my twin brother was born and my master saw him
                        amongts a bunch of puppies! When he came forward he was the one with the
                        'tan ears' and so the two of us were named Tanner. Tanner is a golden
                        doodle! His life was that of a little tiny puppy. My master held out his
                        hands and Tanner my twin ran to him! Fast forward a bit later where my
                        master finds me at the national convention for ventriloquists! My
                        friends were all lined up in a row and one of them was Darcy Lynn’s
                        puppet! I came from her group of friends. My master looked at hundreds
                        of puppets and pick me because I looked like a golden doodle and I had
                        tan ears. You can see that the three of us are like Bobbsey twins and
                        next year we are going to go on tour together two golden doodles and a
                        parrot.
